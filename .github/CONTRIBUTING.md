### Optionally configure HospitalRun Server

In most cases, this is not needed to contribute to the HospitalRun Frontend Repository. The following instructions are for connecting to HospitalRun Server during development and are not intended to be for production use. For production deployments, see the deployment instructions/

1. Configure [HospitalRun Server](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server)
2. Start the HospitalRun Development Server
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
4. Change the `REACT_APP_HOSPITALRUN_API` variable to point to the HospitalRun Development Server.

### Potential Setup Issues

Some developers have reported the following errors and the corresponding fixes

### Problem with Project Dependency Tree

```
There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.
It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.
The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:
  "babel-loader": "8.1.0"
Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.
However, a different version of babel-loader was detected higher up in the tree:
  /path/to/hospitalrun/node_modules/babel-loader (version: 8.0.6)
Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.
If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.
To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:
  1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
  3. Remove "babel-loader" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
```

To fix this issue, add `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` to the `.env` file.

## Running Tests and Linter

`yarn test:ci` will run the entire test suite

`yarn test` will run the test suite in watch mode

`yarn lint` will run the linter

`yarn lint:fix` will run the linter and fix fixable errors

## Working on an Issue

In order to optimize the workflow and to prevent multiple contributors working on the same issue without interactions, a contributor must ask to be assigned to an issue by one of the core team members: it's enough to ask it inside the specific issue.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should be submitted in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/issues), with a description of
the expected behavior & use case, where they’ll remain closed until sufficient interest,
[e.g. :+1: reactions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/),
has been [shown by the community](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/issues?q=label%3A%22votes+needed%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
Before submitting a request, please search for similar ones in the
[closed issues](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aenhancement).

## Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
